The quality of work thus delivered is evidently of  poor standard. But they don't seem to mind.

The main thing one is working for is money. But these people don't take it seriously. That's why many people leave the company every year. There is no employee retention policy. Thry don't care if you leave or stay. They will hire someone else in your place. But they'll never increase your package. The appraisal will be 2-6% which is way way below the market. So personal and financial growth is not there. There is a lot of politics too. ...Read More,"Likes The work environment was great for me. Leave structure is also good.
