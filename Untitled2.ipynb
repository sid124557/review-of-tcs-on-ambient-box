Getting a release from one project is an impossible task, the HR will be ready to let you go out of TCS but will not release from the project, every plea goes unheard. none of the escalations work! the only option is to quit. New joiners are mislead into internal as they lack knowledge and are naive. Experienced people are cheated and thrown into the pit. The internal employees are wise enough to escape the limbo.
