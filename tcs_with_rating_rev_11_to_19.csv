Do not join this place unless you need a job very badly.
This is worst work culture I have come across in my career, the head of the department is the worst leader who do not how to even talk to employees and treat them as if the employees are servants. Therefore the same is done by his deputy. Shouting on employees is a common thing for these guys. They have a very weak knowledge base and do not know anything. As they are failed to bring any good project, thus trying to sell that the employees are very lucky that they got the documentation work and this will improve their career. I don't know how pathetic this sounds but if someone tells that this work is not good then the conclusion they draw is he/she is conspiring against them.

They will hire you by giving false information on the JD and in the interview say that you will get modelling work but in reality there is no work apart from documentation and little bit analysis (if you are lucky you will get this work). After joining when confronted about the promise they have made they will shamelessly say it was your call or can even shout on you.

Since there is no work, all the time they will monitor you like whether you are at desk or not even if you do not have any work and Creating bizzare rules like be seated 9 hours on your desk(other companies have it but only in rule book) else they will call the HR, do not talk with fellow team members ( as they think you are upto something against them), do not laugh as it disturb other employees. All these may sound impractical but these are 100% true my friends. 

The result of this kind of work culture is that, almost every financial year about 60 - 80% of employees resign.

There's a lot of bad experience I had here so I will recommend if possible never join to this location of Tcs, there are 99% chances are you will regret it.
