0,posted on 05 Sep 2018,System Engineer  in Kolkata, Anonymous · Finance Division    ,"Dislikes 1. Growth: Not much scope of growth. Freshers are kept on bench just to show employee strength to potential clients. Most of the time freshers are given boring work like data entry or documentation etc. 
2. Salary: As the work is not challenging, salary is minimal too. Freshers get 3.5 lpa approx. 
3. Work environment: Not really great. Talk about technology is far less heard than gossips. Fear of getting bad rating is the motivation of work. So most of the time people deliver the bare minimum. There is an 8 hrs office time policy but actual work happens for 3-4 hrs only. 
4. Politics: Thick management layer and micromanaged. So politics are everywhere. So much so that actual work become secondary to all the mails and meetings and screenshots. 
5. Learning: You will definitely learn suave moves of office politics, crafty way to send mails and may be few other skills. 
6. Training: Training are given based on project requirements. If an employee has an interest in different technologies, most likely he or she will not a get a chance easily. Resource management is very poor. Employee are forcefully recruited to projects sometime even without their acknowledgement.
...Read More","Likes Few things that are good: 
1. Job security. In my opinion 80% of the  people who are in TCS is because of job security. TCS holds onto their employees even in tough situations in market although there was a large layoff in recent past. Still job security is a plus.
2.Work-life balance:  It is good. Most of the time there are no pressure and also work is not much challenging. So usually after the timid learning curve it is   easy work-wise. In support projects timing may be an issue because one may have to support weekend or at night but those are compensated. In development projects timing at beginning is casual but at time of delivery it is haywire because always there are no time but lot of development left. This should give an idea of poor management.
3. Benefits: Nice health benefits for employee and family, easy on leaves about maternity, wedding etc. ...Read More",2

One HR manager told me TCS salary are like weather forecasting. another HR manager told me, you may need to pay TCS for working in TCS. I have written proof.
2. They deduct salary of a person after joining. Don't give allocation even if your are actively working in a project. And hence, salary cut.
3. I have never seen such regionalism in any other organisation in India like TCS. North manager does not like south manager and vise a versa, Telegu manager does not like Tamil, Tamil manager does not like Kannadiga etc. etc.
4. There are few managers who takes money from recruitment firm. Those managers recruit people even if current project is over populated. In my project, they could not even allocate a bug per head per week. I mentioned the same to Regional HR manager, but no action was taken. This is overt secret in TCS.
5. TCS encourages its employee to use personal laptop or computer to connect and work in client network. I have written proof. I raised the concern to appropriate authority. But No Action was taken, in fact the guy from grievance cell was trying to implicate one fresher for the same.   ...Read More",Likes You can draw salary without doing any work and even without going to office a single day in a month.,2

8,posted on 28 Nov 2019,Systems Engineer  in Bangalore, Anonymous · Manufacturing Division    ,"Dislikes Things which needs to be looked into,
1. Having a clear roadmap to execute a given work load needs to be improved.
2. Senior associates should too invest some time at coding with novice developers to help them learn better.
3. Blame game is bad if you have such people in your project.
4. Ample time needs to be given to developers for application development, things should not be in a hurry.
5. Salary Hike is not so impressive for junior associates who are starting there career with TCS. Good associates feel forced to leave the company just because of low salary increment. If this criteria is looked upon, TCS can retain good quality employees.
6. Infrastructure Team at TCS needs to work quickly.
7. Approval for any activity from higher level management takes too much time, needs to have a good,smooth and quick workflow.
8. People who work are made to work too much. But those who don't work are neither asked to work nor any action is taken against them(politics).
9. Annual Appraisal process needs to be reviewed, current one is not upto the mark as most people work only during appraisals, or they get good ratings just because they act close to their appraisers.

3. Too many people to interact with.
4. Chance to work on the very latest technologies (again it's project specific).

a) The project has On-site work.
b) Years of working at TCS by the employee.
c) Immeasurable Knowledge with equally impressive articulation skill with good soft skills (Soft-skill is very important).

Do not join this place unless you need a job very badly.
This is worst work culture I have come across in my career, the head of the department is the worst leader who do not how to even talk to employees and treat them as if the employees are servants. Therefore the same is done by his deputy. Shouting on employees is a common thing for these guys. They have a very weak knowledge base and do not know anything. As they are failed to bring any good project, thus trying to sell that the employees are very lucky that they got the documentation work and this will improve their career. I don't know how pathetic this sounds but if someone tells that this work is not good then the conclusion they draw is he/she is conspiring against them.

They will hire you by giving false information on the JD and in the interview say that you will get modelling work but in reality there is no work apart from documentation and little bit analysis (if you are lucky you will get this work). After joining when confronted about the promise they have made they will shamelessly say it was your call or can even shout on you.

Since there is no work, all the time they will monitor you like whether you are at desk or not even if you do not have any work and Creating bizzare rules like be seated 9 hours on your desk(other companies have it but only in rule book) else they will call the HR, do not talk with fellow team members ( as they think you are upto something against them), do not laugh as it disturb other employees. All these may sound impractical but these are 100% true my friends. 

The result of this kind of work culture is that, almost every financial year about 60 - 80% of employees resign.

There's a lot of bad experience I had here so I will recommend if possible never join to this location of Tcs, there are 99% chances are you will regret it.
