They do not care about the skillsets of the employee. The provisions taken to assign any employee to a project is laughable. Whether applicants are coding hires or herded like sheep, they are categorized the same. If you know java / python - expect to be assigned any support project as they don't care about the skill set at all. Only thing I learnt there is that you cannot depend on your higher ups to take any action according to you. Career growth and learning are just a ruse here as those things are available to people who stay in office on bench and have ample time to do nothing but surf the mails and participate in the random seminars. I had attended some of the seminars and none of them were comprehensible, or at the least audible. 

For people working in locations other than Bangalore, I hope the situation isn't as dire as this.

P.S. As per the internal news, the management is taking provisions to ensure that correct skillset mapping is done at the RMG level. If they fail to do so, they will be facing the consequences. Please ensure that your superiors do not the unduly advantage....Read More","Likes The teamwork and the ambiance at the ILP was one of the highlights of my entire experience.

Your personal ambitions are kept on the back seat and you may not be given appropriate training which you want. Your work is not decided based on what you are good at rather it is decided based on their requirements which many a times lead to improper resource management and even ruining one's career. Also in recent times the compensation has been terrible with highest hike being given around 7%.
