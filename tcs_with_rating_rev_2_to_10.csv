One HR manager told me TCS salary are like weather forecasting. another HR manager told me, you may need to pay TCS for working in TCS. I have written proof.
2. They deduct salary of a person after joining. Don't give allocation even if your are actively working in a project. And hence, salary cut.
3. I have never seen such regionalism in any other organisation in India like TCS. North manager does not like south manager and vise a versa, Telegu manager does not like Tamil, Tamil manager does not like Kannadiga etc. etc.
4. There are few managers who takes money from recruitment firm. Those managers recruit people even if current project is over populated. In my project, they could not even allocate a bug per head per week. I mentioned the same to Regional HR manager, but no action was taken. This is overt secret in TCS.
5. TCS encourages its employee to use personal laptop or computer to connect and work in client network. I have written proof. I raised the concern to appropriate authority.

3. Blame game is bad if you have such people in your project.
4. Ample time needs to be given to developers for application development, things should not be in a hurry.
5. Salary Hike is not so impressive for junior associates who are starting there career with TCS. Good associates feel forced to leave the company just because of low salary increment. If this criteria is looked upon, TCS can retain good quality employees.
6. Infrastructure Team at TCS needs to work quickly.
7. Approval for any activity from higher level management takes too much time, needs to have a good,smooth and quick workflow.
8. People who work are made to work too much. But those who don't work are neither asked to work nor any action is taken against them(politics).
